OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT-> STOCK PRICES TREND PREDICTION USING SENTIMENT ANALYSIS ON TWEETS AND NEWS HEADLINES FEED
- Predicting the trend of stock prices for 5 companies - Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, JP Morgan and Boeing
- Analyzing how twitter posts affect stock prices,
- Analysing how news feed affects stock prices and
- Analysing how the popularity of a brand in market at a particular time has influenced the stock prices.


On the presentation day, following team members provided us the feedback on understanding and improving our project:
1. SAMPATH ALLU
2. ABHILASH TIRUVEEDHULA
3. DEEPAK RAJA REDDY BILLA
They posed us a question regarding:
- How we plan to merge that Twitter and News Feed data 
- Setting multiple bins of the sentiments in order to get more meaning from the sentiment analysis that is to be performed on Twitter and News data
- Aggregating data wrt weekly/monthly to perform data analysis.
- How will you employ scrapping too much data from Twitter.

As our objectives have not changed since we submit the project proposal; we proceeded to encounter these feedbacks into our project's initial phase i.e.
to get the data and perform analysis on it.
- We plan to merge the data, once we have performed analysis on Twitter data and on News feed data. This is giving us the opportunity to find
which source is serving as a more reliable source to impact the stock prices. Later in the process, we plan to employ the concept of weighted sentiments
in order to get the combined sentiments from both datasets and then perform analysis to understand the impact on stock prices.
- The idea of setting multiple bins to sentiments and thus categorizing them into 2-3 categories would be the best option for us to get the
most from the textual information we have got from twitter as well as News Feed data.
- We have the data that represents the information collected for the month of March. We'll continue the process of extracting data for about 2 weeks more.
We don't need to aggregate the data in a weekly manner because we have all the other data with respect to dates, thus we can perform analysis on this data.
- We have performed the process of scrapping the data from Twitter as a part of the daily process, because of all the limitations that Twitter applies
to scrape the data using Twitter API. We still have managed to get the data from $(company ticker-symbol) Latest page on Twitter.

We have found the benefits from the feedback as it has allowed us to question more details about the process and the scope of the process.
